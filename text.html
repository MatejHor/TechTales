            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p class="fade fade1">My background starts at the Faculty of Informatics and Information Technology at Slovak Technical
                University. where I successfully completed my bachelor's degree. My thesis focused on the application of
                deep learning in the medical domain. During my time at this institution, I touch almost every aspect of
                computer science and gained proficiency in diverse programming paradigms. The curriculum encompassed a
                comprehensive range, from understanding the logic of single and multiple register CPU, low-level
                programming languages such as C, networking, Unix kernel utilization, bash scripting, and database
                systems, to
                fundamental principles in artificial Intelligence, web technologies, higher-level programming languages,
                and User Experience (UX) design.</p>

            <p>After that, I directed my focus towards Artificial intelligence, where I studied the field of Artificial
                intelligence and processing of Big Data at Masaryk University in Brno. Here my master's thesis was
                oriented around the broader applications of Artificial intelligence in the real world within IT
                companies. This
                academic phase provided an extensive exploration of AI covering areas such as state space search,
                genetic algorithms, outlier detection, Natural Language Processing (NLP), deep learning, information
                retrieval,
                machine learning, among others. The curriculum also extended beyond AI, incorporating database systems,
                encompassing both relational databases (with a focus on optimization and efficiency) and NoSQL databases
                like Redis, Mongo, Elastic, etc... Here I gained insights what are the main duties of data-oriented
                roles understanding data warehouses, cloud computing and the architecture of supercomputers.</p>

            <p>Towards my academic pursuits, I searched for practical experience in the professional world. This led me
                to have part-time jobs where I assumed roles such as a software engineer, AI developer, ETL pipeline
                specialist, and Data engineer. These experiences have been instrumental in reinforcing and applying the
                theoretical knowledge acquired during my academic journey.</p>

                <h3>ETL-Scrapper</h3>
                <p>Sophisticated job portal scraper meticulously designed to curate a
                    comprehensive database of current job listings.Featuring custom middleware to efficiently handle
                    multiple proxies, the scraping process is orchestrated through a configuration file.
                    The ETL pipeline, a core organizational structure of the project, encompasses various stages.
                    Starting with scraping entire pages for job listings, the subsequent steps involve modifying
                    content. This includes language identification, translation into specific languages, summarization
                    of content (both HTML and plain text), extraction of specific fields, and finally, loading the data
                    into a relational database. Each scraping portal is equipped with its own spider, ensuring optimized
                    results for search fields.
                    This project seamlessly combines the power of Python, Scrapy, and ETL methodologies to deliver a
                    comprehensive solution for creating and managing a dynamic job database

                <p>Classification of semiconductor chip layers in a FIB-SEM microscope.
                    In my master thesis, I collaborated with an external company specializing in the soldering of
                    semiconductor chips with defects, aiming to identify the specific layer where errors occurred for
                    further inspection. Given the minute scale of the chips, only a few nanometers, a focused ion beam
                    was employed to desolder the layers, and their content was examined using a scanning electron
                    microscope. With the objective of improving accuracy and expediting the process, I endeavored to
                    invent an algorithm capable of detecting the layer within the chip efficiently. Despite a limited
                    dataset, I explored a mix of general algorithms, favoring practicality over deep learning. My
                    implemented alternatives encompassed clustering, neural networks with smaller architectures,
                    template comparison, and adaptive thresholding. The method I devised, utilizing white/black hat for
                    data cleaning, structure tensor for edge detection, and computing histograms of inflexion points,
                    outperformed others, showcasing superior results.

                <p>Processing of volumetric medical data to support medical diagnostics via deep learning a.k.a.
                    Processing of image data using artificial intelligence methods.
                    In my bachelor thesis, I delved into the realm of processing volumetric medical data to support
                    medical diagnostics through the application of deep learning, specifically the processing of image
                    data using artificial intelligence methods. My focus centered on comparing different
                    approaches—manual and automatic—of creating kernels in convolutional neural networks. Employing the
                    Unet architecture, the task involved classifying images to determine the presence of tumors. The
                    dataset encompassed images of breast cancer and histological images of cancer in the kidney.

                    For comparison, I explored classical approaches like creating kernels through backpropagation,
                    leveraging autoencoders to simplify images for subsequent classification, and implementing transfer
                    learning by utilizing weights from different models. The final approach involved a manual
                    touch—using a Gaussian function to create a filter for the kernel. Remarkably, the best results
                    emerged from a hybrid approach, manually defining a kernel from a Gaussian function that was later
                    refined, albeit not entirely overridden, through backpropagation iterations
